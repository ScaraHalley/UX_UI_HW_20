                        I reached out to the NAA to understand their needs of
                        the site, and what they want the public to get out of
                        using their services. RecordSearch is complicated to
                        use, NAA employees are concerned it will be hard for
                        them to use if its made easier for the public to use.
                        Archivists are often needed to provided 1-on-1 support

                The way information is organised at the top of the screen, is
                very different compared to the bottom of the screen. When
                comparing them the bottom navigation is much more logical,
                grouping categories by the different user types. Our hypothesis

                During the card sorting process there were common groupings, but
                as shown in our User Tests of the website navigation, the users
                were unsure what a lot of headings meant, especially the
                headings for the government. The conclusion drawn from testing
                was the we need to break down the information architecture into
                3 main groups for Researchers, for Schools & Teachers and for
                Government users, and create tertiary navigation to group pages
                within the same categories

                Based on card sorting results, Adobe XD was used to redesign the
                site information architecture to follow a similar flow to the
                bottom navigation.
              </p>
              <p>
                Breaking the headings to the site resources into the three user
                categories: researcher, school & teachers and government.

              <p>
                Links were included to pages that had only been accessible from
                the bottom navigation in the top navigation.
              </p>
              <p>
                Some of the secondary headings were moved to create tertiary
                headings to order the information in a way that is easier for
                users to understand at a glance

              <p>

                Keeping in mind the age and tech savviness of our proto-persona
                2 versions of the mobile wireframe were created to compare
                usability and access task flow in AB testing

              <p>
                Test A was the preferred 80% of the time when discussing ease of
                navigation, when Test B was preferred the user took much longer
                to understand Test B and quickly navigated through Test A
              </p>
              <p>
                Homescreen layouts were tied on preference, service buttons
                should be stacked for accessibility
              </p>
              <p>
                Having the sitemap located within the overlay menu was a failure
                and should stay located at bottom of the screen
              </p>
              <p>
                Outcomes reinforced the usefulness of having the tertiary menu
                visible first as the user experienced more lostness when they
                couldn’t see the options first Will keep add a burger menu with
                a menu label to the Test A prototype and develop that design

                A modern color palette reminiscent of the Australian green and
                gold, that will pair nicely with the archival photographs was
                chosen. Which passes color usability testing with a AAA rating

                Clear San Serif fonts chosen for the typography for easy

                Key changes were made to the final interactions based of user

              <p>
                The goal of the current project were met, but based of the
                feedback from stakeholder research, RecordSearch is long overdue
                for an update, as it has been avoided as staff find it difficult
                to use and are worried updates may make some functions
                inaccessible
              </p>
              <p>
                Current iterations should be tested with staff and research the
                functions needed by the government. The scope of the redesign
                can be expanded to the RecordSearch function to benefit both the
                needs of the NAA staff and the needs of the public
