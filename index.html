          <p>
            The NAA collects Australian Government records, manages them,
            preserves them and makes them public. The purpose is so the public
            can access evidence of government decisions and actions, making them
            transparent and accountable.
          </p>
        </div>

        <h4 class="col-md-3 ">Heuristic Evaluation</h4>
        <div class="col-md-9 ">
          <p>
            The current NNA site could improve greatly, its purpose is unclear
            and the accessibility rating is below the current standard at only
            AA, and multiple methods are used to present information chunks to
            the user which adds to confusion when interacting with the site.
          </p>
          <p>
            The aim in this project will be to redesign the site for better user
            accessibility .
          </p>
          <p>
            The goal of this project is to redesign the site to increase
            usability to the current standard of AAA and boost interaction with
            services from the public
          </p>
        </div></div> <div class="row">
        <h4 class="col-md-3">Stakeholder Research</h4>
        <div class="col-md-9 ">
          <p>
            I reached out to the NAA to understand their needs of the site, and
            what they want the public to get out of using their services
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Both public and government use NAA</li>
            <li>
              1-on-1 support is needed when public can’t use site, support is
              provided by the government archivalists, who have other work as
              well
            </li>
            <li>
              RecordSearch is complicated to use, NAA employees are concerned it
              will be hard for them to use if its made easier for the public to
              use.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            To avoid the scope of the project to expand beyond the deadline,
            focus for now will just be on the site’s overall navigation in
            mobile and desktop devices.
          </p>
          <p>
            Future iterations should look into making the RecordSearch feature
            more user friendly for both the Government and the public’s needs
          </p>
          <p>
            The Proto Persona we designed is based of the older user, who has an
            interest in researching personal family history. They are less tech
            savvy than a younger user, and use their desktop computer to access
            the site when doing their research. Due to this the focus of our
            research this round will be the desktop version of the site and
            making sure the design is responsive to different screen sizes.
            Although it would be valuable to look into the mobile version in
            later iterations
          </p>
          <p>
            The assumption entering User Testing was that an older user would
            struggle to navigate the current site. This assumption was proven
            correct, but what was surprising was that the users felt that they
            were the ones at fault for struggling to navigate the site, not the
            site itself, and were sure they just needed time to figure the site
            out.

        <div class="col-md-9 ">
          <p>
            The way information is organised at the top of the screen, is very
            different compared to the bottom of the screen. When comparing them
            the bottom navigation is much more logical, grouping categories by
            the different user types. Our hypothesis is organising the top
            navigation

        <h4 class="col-md-3">Navigation Open Card Sorting</h4>
        <div class="col-md-9">
          <p>
            During the card sorting process there were common groupings, but as
            shown in our User Tests of the website navigation, the users were
            unsure what a lot of headings meant, especially the headings for the
            government. The conclusion drawn from testing was the we need to
            break down the information architecture into 3 main groups for
            Researchers, for Schools & Teachers and for Government users, and
            create tertiary navigation to group pages within the same categories

        <h4 class="col-md-3">Sitemap Redesign</h4>
        <div class="col-md-9 ">
          <p>
            Based on card sorting results, Adobe XD was used to redesign the
            site information architecture to follow a similar flow to the bottom
            navigation.
          </p>
          <p>
            Breaking the headings to the site resources into the three user
            categories: researcher, school & teachers and government.
          </p>
          <p>
            Links were included to pages that had only been accessible from the
            bottom navigation in the top navigation.
          </p>
          <p>
            Some of the secondary headings were moved to create tertiary
            headings to order the information in a way that is easier for users
            to understand at a glance

            During testing the users would always navigate from the top menu bar
            and browse their options. The longline dropdown of the menu has been
            used for a more comfortable browsing experience. With the indented
            tertiary menu to make categories clear without hiding information
            from users

          <p>
            The header navigation was separated from the top of the screen to
            stand out to the user and styles and transitions were added
          </p>
          <p>
            Maintaining tertiary headings as visible with secondary headings,
            aim is to minimise lostiness with user
          </p>
          <p>
            Will be incorporating this within the mobile prototypes as well and

            Keeping in mind the age and tech savviness of our proto-persona 2
            versions of the mobile wireframe were created to compare usability
            and access task flow in AB testing

          <p>
            Test A was the preferred 80% of the time when discussing ease of
            navigation, when Test B was preferred the user took much longer to
            understand Test B and quickly navigated through Test A
          </p>
          <p>
            Homescreen layouts were tied on preference, service buttons should
            be stacked for accessibility
          </p>
          <p>
            Having the sitemap located within the overlay menu was a failure and
            should stay located at bottom of the screen
          </p>
          <p>
            Outcomes reinforced the usefulness of having the tertiary menu
            visible first as the user experienced more lostiness when they
            couldn’t see the options first Will keep add a burger menu with a
            menu label to the Test A prototype and develop that design

          <p>
            The goal of the current project were met, but based of the feedback
            from stakeholder research, RecordSearch is long overdue for an
            update, as it has been avoided as staff find it difficult to use and
            are worried updates may make some functions inaccessible
          </p>
          <p>
            Current iterations should be tested with staff and research the
            functions needed by the government. The scope of the redesign can be
            expanded to the RecordSearch function to benefit both the needs of
            the NAA staff and the needs of the public
